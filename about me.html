<p>My name is Alex Provis. I was born on the 3rd of July 2005. I like music, computers, books and video games. In my spare time, I like to read and listen to music. In Primary school I did swimming lessons and I earned my 50 metre badge. Aside from swimming, I am not a very active person but I do ride my bike occasionally. I like all sorts of music, but I really enjoy Metal and Rock. I occasionally play bass in my free time. I like making dance styled music whenever I feel like it. </p>
