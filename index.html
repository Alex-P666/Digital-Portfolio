<p>Welcome to my digital portfolio website. My name is Alex Provis, I am a level 2 IT student. I am making this digital portfolio in hopes of finding a job in the IT industry as well as for viewing by my tutors, classmates, and future employers.
I would like a job that I can enjoy doing. I am studying at Bridgend College. I am currently doing an Information and Creative technologies Level 2 course. I would like to continue on the Level 3 course and increase my knowledge on hardware and software in the future</p>
